Installation Manual

The installation Manual will be of 2 sections where the first section is the main submission of a dockerized application, the second section is only used if the docker container fails, and so that marking can still be done (this is unlikely to be used since we have tested the docker container).
Docker installation:
1. Clone the repo : [https://github.com/unsw-cse-comp99-3900-24t1/capstone-project-3900w09bscoutsregiment]
Via ssh: 

git clone git@github.com:unsw-cse-comp99-3900-24t1/capstone-project-3900w09bscoutsregiment.git

2. Navigate to the repo 

cd capstone-project-3900w09bscoutsregiment

3. Include the .env file for the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory, make a .env file, then fill it with the content provided below.

cd frontend
touch .env
// Fill file with appropriate content
cd ..

4. Include the .env file for the backend, navigate to the backend, make a .env file, and fill it with the content provided below

cd backend
touch .env
// fill file with appropriate content
cd ..

5. Build the docker container 

docker-compose up â€“build

6. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser and you can start using the app ðŸ˜„. 

Note: It might take a few seconds for ANY page on the website to render. 

Note: if the development server crashes, just docker-compose up â€“build again, it is most likely caused by the remote free plan Mongodb database.
